# Snake-Game-Project
Building a Snake Game for C++ Project.

## Description

This project is a classic Snake game implemented in C++ for the console environment. The objective is to maneuver a growing snake around the game grid, collect food items to gain points, and avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own body. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including game logic, input handling, and data structures.

## Features

- Responsive console-based gameplay
- Dynamic snake growth upon eating food
- Random food placement on the grid
- Collision detection (walls and self)
- Simple and modular code architecture

## Technologies Used

- C++ (Standard Library)
- Console input/output for game interaction

## Requirements

To run this project on your PC, you need:

- A modern operating system (Windows)
- A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., g++, clang++, MSVC)
- Command line/terminal access to compile and run the executable
- For Windows users: `conio.h` support (available in MinGW or Visual Studio environments). If you don't have MinGW installed, you can download it from [MinGW-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) and follow the installation instructions to set up the GCC compiler on your system.
- Basic familiarity with command line usage for compilation and execution
