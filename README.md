# Snake-Game-Project
Building a Snake Game for C++ Project.

## Description

This project is a classic Snake game implemented in C++ for the console environment. The objective is to maneuver a growing snake around the game grid, collect food items to gain points, and avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own tail. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including game logic, input handling, and data structures.

## Features

- Responsive console-based gameplay
- Dynamic snake growth upon eating food
- Random food placement on the grid
- Collision detection (walls and self)
- Simple and modular code architecture

## Technologies Used

- C++ (Standard Library)
- Console input/output for game interaction

## Acknowledgments

- Inspired by the classic Snake game
- Developed as an educational project for learning C++ and game programming concepts
- Thanks to the C++ open-source community and relevant tutorials
